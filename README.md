# Sentinel-AI

** Sentinel-AI** is a modular open-source toolkit for detecting, preventing, and understanding misuse in generative AI systems.  
It is designed for developers, researchers, and digital rights advocates focused on AI safety, robustness, and transparency.

> ðŸ”¬ Modules include data poisoning detection, bias analysis, and prompt injection defense.

---

## Features

- ** Poison Detection** â€“ Identify outliers in structured datasets (CSV)  
- ** Bias Analysis** â€“ Analyze and quantify representation and skew in data *(coming soon)*  
- **Prompt Security** â€“ Detect prompt injection and insecure model outputs *(in development)*  
- CLI & Python API for flexible integration  
- Privacy-first, no data ever leaves your machine

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install sentinel-ai
Requires: Python 3.8+

 Basic Usage
 Data Poisoning Detection (CSV)
python
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
from sentinel_ai import poison

# Run detection on a dataset
results = poison.detect_outliers("data.csv")

# Print flagged rows
print(results[results["flagged"] == True])
 Works with CSV files containing numeric data. Header row is optional.

 Use Cases
AI Red-Teaming & Adversarial Testing

Dataset Auditing & Verification

Prompt Filter Development

Fairness & Bias Research

Digital Rights Toolkits

ðŸ›¡ Philosophy
Sentinel-AI is built around the idea of responsible AI empowerment â€“ providing tools to detect misuse, not restrict use.
We believe developers should be equipped to protect models, users, and systems from unintended consequences.

 Roadmap
 poison: CSV-based outlier detection

 bias: Fairness metrics, representation analysis

 prompt: Injection pattern detection, response sanitization

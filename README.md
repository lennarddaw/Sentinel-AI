# 🛡️ Sentinel-AI

**Sentinel-AI** is a modular open-source toolkit for detecting, preventing, and understanding misuse in generative AI systems.  
It is designed for developers, researchers, and digital rights advocates focused on AI safety, robustness, and transparency.

> 🔬 Modules include data poisoning detection, bias analysis, and prompt injection defense.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ **Poison Detection** – Identify outliers in structured datasets (CSV)  
- ⚖️ **Bias Analysis** – Analyze and quantify representation and skew in data *(coming soon)*  
- 🧠 **Prompt Security** – Detect prompt injection and insecure model outputs *(in development)*  
- 📊 CLI & Python API for flexible integration  
- 🔒 Privacy-first, no data ever leaves your machine

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📥 Installation

```bash
pip install sentinel-ai
Requires: Python 3.8+

🧪 Basic Usage
🧬 Data Poisoning Detection (CSV)
python
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
from sentinel_ai import poison

# Run detection on a dataset
results = poison.detect_outliers("data.csv")

# Print flagged rows
print(results[results["flagged"] == True])
📌 Works with CSV files containing numeric data. Header row is optional.

🧠 Use Cases
AI Red-Teaming & Adversarial Testing

Dataset Auditing & Verification

Prompt Filter Development

Fairness & Bias Research

Digital Rights Toolkits

🛡️ Philosophy
Sentinel-AI is built around the idea of responsible AI empowerment – providing tools to detect misuse, not restrict use.
We believe developers should be equipped to protect models, users, and systems from unintended consequences.

🧩 Roadmap
✅ poison: CSV-based outlier detection

⬜ bias: Fairness metrics, representation analysis

⬜ prompt: Injection pattern detection, response sanitization

⬜ GUI frontend (Qt/Web)

⬜ Community-sourced pattern libraries
